### About me

Hi, I'm Valeriya! I live in St. Petersburg and work as a dispatcher in an airline. At first, website development was my hobby, but now I am seriously thinking about changing my professional field. Creating user-friendly and accessible websites is what I really love to do. And I plan to improve my skills!
